# cuba-sample-web-component

This project demonstrates customizing of a standard CUBA UI component: `PickerField`. The [customized implementation](https://github.com/knstvk/cuba-sample-web-component/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/components/MyWebPickerField.java) configures `LookupAction` in such a way that all lookup screens are opened in `OpenType.DIALOG` mode.
